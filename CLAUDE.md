This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## About This Project

**Converb** by Adidev Plugin Suite — a convolution reverb effect plugin (`PLUGIN_MANUFACTURER_CODE Adps`, `PLUGIN_CODE Cnvb`). Builds default to **Debug**; use Release (`cmake-build-release`) if you hit dropouts or high CPU while making music. CI runs the full Linux/macOS/Windows matrix with IPP and code signing disabled.

This project is derived from the [Pamplejuce](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce) template — a JUCE audio plugin template using CMake, C++23, and modern CI/CD. It builds cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux) with support for multiple plugin formats (VST3, AU, AUv3, CLAP, Standalone).

The template provides the build system, CI/CD, and project structure. The plugin-specific logic lives in `source/`.

## Build Commands

The IDE is CLion. Use CLion's build directories and its bundled Ninja so CLI and IDE builds share `.ninja_log`.

```bash
NINJA=/Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/ninja/mac/aarch64/ninja

# Configure (run once, or after CMakeLists.txt changes)
cmake -B cmake-build-debug -G Ninja -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=$NINJA -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build
cmake --build cmake-build-debug

# Run tests (from project root)
ctest --test-dir cmake-build-debug --verbose --output-on-failure

# Or run tests directly
./cmake-build-debug/Tests

# Run a single test by name
./cmake-build-debug/Tests "[test name]"

# Run benchmarks
./cmake-build-debug/Benchmarks
```

Release builds: same commands with `cmake-build-release` and `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.

On macOS for universal binary: `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"`

## Project Structure

- `source/` - Plugin source code (PluginProcessor, PluginEditor)
- `tests/` - Catch2 test files
- `benchmarks/` - Catch2 benchmark files
- `cmake/` - CMake modules (Tests.cmake, Benchmarks.cmake, Assets.cmake, etc.)
- `modules/` - Git submodules: clap-juce-extensions, melatonin_inspector
- `JUCE/` - JUCE framework (git submodule)
- `assets/` - Binary resources (auto-included via juce_add_binary_data)
- `packaging/` - Installer resources and scripts

## Architecture

**SharedCode Library**: The `SharedCode` INTERFACE library links plugin source code to both the main plugin target and the Tests target, avoiding ODR violations.

**CMake Modules**:
- `PamplejuceVersion.cmake` - Reads VERSION file, optional auto-bump patch level
- `PamplejuceFunctions.cmake` - One include that defines the `pamplejuce_*` functions below (and turns off their legacy include-time behavior)
- `PamplejuceIPP.cmake` - Intel IPP integration (optional)

Target setup happens via explicit function calls in `CMakeLists.txt`, not at include time:
- `pamplejuce_add_assets()` - Includes all files in assets/ as binary data (from `Assets.cmake`)
- `pamplejuce_add_tests()` - Configures the Catch2 test target (from `Tests.cmake`)
- `pamplejuce_add_benchmarks()` - Configures the Catch2 benchmark target (from `Benchmarks.cmake`)
- `pamplejuce_shared_code_defaults()` - C++23, fast math (from `SharedCodeDefaults.cmake`)
- `pamplejuce_xcode_prettify()` - Xcode folder/scheme cleanup (from `XcodePrettify.cmake`)

Note: after `include(PamplejuceFunctions)`, a plain `include(Tests)` (or Assets, etc.) is a no-op - call the function instead.

**Test Discovery**: Uses `catch_discover_tests()` with `PRE_TEST` discovery mode for Xcode compatibility.

## Key Configuration

Edit `CMakeLists.txt` to customize:
- `PROJECT_NAME` - Internal name (no spaces)
- `PRODUCT_NAME` - Display name in DAWs (can have spaces)
- `COMPANY_NAME` - Used for bundle name
- `BUNDLE_ID` - macOS bundle identifier
- `FORMATS` - Plugin formats to build (Standalone AU VST3 AUv3)
- `PLUGIN_MANUFACTURER_CODE` / `PLUGIN_CODE` - 4-character plugin IDs

Version is read from the `VERSION` file in project root.

## Code Quality

Always resolve any compile warnings encountered during builds. Warnings should be treated as errors and fixed before considering a task complete.

Note: LSP/clangd often reports false positive diagnostic errors (like "undeclared identifier", "file not found") because it doesn't have full context of the JUCE module system. Ignore these unless the actual build fails.

## Includes

JUCE modules include common standard library headers (`<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, `<string>`, `<memory>`, etc.) so you don't need to add those explicitly in JUCE code. Adding them is harmless but redundant.

## Threading Model

JUCE plugins have two main threads:

- **Audio thread**: Runs `processBlock` — must be realtime-safe (see below). Never block, allocate, or lock.
- **Message thread**: Runs UI callbacks, parameter listeners, and timer callbacks. Owns the `MessageManager`.

To communicate between them:
- **Simple values**: Use `std::atomic` or JUCE's `AudioParameterFloat`/`AudioParameterBool` (which are atomic under the hood)
- **Larger data**: Use a lock-free queue (e.g. `moodycamel::ReaderWriterQueue`) to pass data from message → audio thread
- **Audio → UI updates**: Use `juce::AsyncUpdater` or `juce::Timer` on the message thread to poll state — never call UI code from the audio thread

## Realtime Safety

For anything in the audio thread / hot DSP path (e.g. `processBlock`):
- Allocate in constructors or `prepareToPlay`, not while rendering audio
- Avoid dynamic allocations and container growth (`std::vector::push_back`, map insertion, string building)
- Prefer fixed-size storage (`std::array`, preallocated buffers, fixed-capacity queues)
- Keep operations deterministic and lock-free where possible

## Adding Dependencies

**JUCE Modules** live in `modules/` as git submodules. Add with `git submodule add`, then `add_subdirectory` and link to `SharedCode` in `CMakeLists.txt`. Some useful ones:

- [melatonin_inspector](https://github.com/sudara/melatonin_inspector) — runtime component debugger (already included)
- [melatonin_blur](https://github.com/sudara/melatonin_blur) — fast cross-platform blurs for C++ UI (shadows, glows, frosted glass)
- [melatonin_perfetto](https://github.com/sudara/melatonin_perfetto) — performance tracing with Perfetto, great for profiling `processBlock` and paint calls
- [gin](https://github.com/FigBug/gin) — large collection of utilities (DSP, UI components, LookAndFeel, etc.)

**Non-JUCE C++ libraries** should be added via [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) which is already configured. CPM downloads and caches dependencies at configure time — no submodule needed:

```cmake
CPMAddPackage("gh:nlohmann/json@3.11.3")
target_link_libraries(SharedCode INTERFACE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json)
```

Some useful CPM libraries:
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) — JSON parsing/serialization
- [cameron314/readerwriterqueue](https://github.com/cameron314/readerwriterqueue) — lock-free single-producer/single-consumer queue, ideal for audio↔message thread communication

## Code Style

Uses `.clang-format` with Allman-style braces, 4-space indentation, no column limit.
